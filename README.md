# HangmanProject
This is a small hangman game project using PHP/Symfony I completed over a weekend with no prior Symfony knowledge as a coding example

Technologies used:
Bootstrap 4, 
Font Awesome 5, 
PHP 8, 
Symfony 5, 
jQuery 3

To get started you need to set up both PHP 8 and Symfony 5 (along with composer). For PHP follow this link...

https://www.php.net/releases/8.0/en.php

And continue to follow the instructions on installing PHP 8. For Symfony 5 follow this link...

https://symfony.com/download

And follow the instructions to get symfony set up on your system. There is a link for composer within the symfony setup documents here...

https://symfony.com/doc/4.2/setup.html#installing-symfony

From here jump on to your local flavour of terminal and nativgate to
the directory where you placed this repository e.g. C:\Users\...\Documents\HangmanProject, make sure you are at the top level with the src folder etc within, now run the following command...

<!--This will install any needed packages to run this locally-->
composer install

<!--then this-->

<!--This will start the local server-->
symfony server:start

This will start a small local webserver for this project to run on. By default the standard address is https://127.0.0.1:8000, head on over
to this page and you should be greated with my project home page. Enter your name, DOB and pick a difficulty. Good luck! Please note no 
information is stored this is simply a small coding example.

// To stop the local server cmd+c out and use command
symfony server:stop

Any issues please contact me.
