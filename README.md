# HangmanProject
This is a small hangman game project using PHP/Symfony I completed over a weekend with no prior Symfony knowledge as a coding example

Technologies used:
Bootstrap 4
Font Awesome 5
PHP 8
Symfony 5
jQuery 3

To get started you need to set up both PHP 8 and Symfony 5. For PHP follow this link...

https://www.php.net/releases/8.0/en.php

And continue to follow the instructions on installing PHP 8. For Symfony 5 follow this link...

https://symfony.com/download

And follow the instructions to get symfony set up on your system. From here jump on to your local flavour of terminal and nativgate to
the directory where you placed this repository e.g. C:\Users\...\Documents\HangmanProject now run the following command...

symfony server:start

This will start a small local webserver for this project to run on. By default the standard address is https://127.0.0.1:8000, head on over
to this page and you should be greated with my project home page. Enter your name, DOB and pick a difficulty. Good luck! Please note no 
information is stored this is simply a small coding example.

Any issues please contact me.
